# Hack Emulator

A work in progress - it doesn't do much yet!

Fill.hack: Hold down "R" key, then tap "Ctrl" - screen will *slowly* fill up with black pixels...

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheInvader360/hack-emulator
cd hack-emulator
```

Then:

```bash
go run HackEmulator.go -path=./roms/Fill.hack
```

## Commands

```bash
Ctrl+R = Reset
Ctrl+Q = Quit
```
